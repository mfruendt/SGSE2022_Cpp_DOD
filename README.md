# SGSE C++ project that implements a very basic ECS to handle its simulation.

The ECS implementation is based of the blog entry https://www.david-colson.com/2020/02/09/making-a-simple-ecs.html from David Colson.
For displaying the simulation SFML is used https://www.sfml-dev.org/.
For Visual Studio Code integration https://github.com/rewrking/sfml-vscode-boilerplate is used as base project.
